ROS Hexapod Stack
--------------------

A hexapod robot stack that provides locomotion and provides odometry and depth sensor
streams.

This is my implementation of a hexapod functioning in the ROS framework. It is still very much a work in progress and I am still actively developing it. 

Gait style is a simple sinusoidal tripod gait. I chose it due to its simplicity and smooth transitions between steps.
